\section{Lecture 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}

\subsection{What is Intelligence?}

Something is intelligent if it can communicate, it has internal knowledge, it has world knowledge, it has intentions and plans to fulfil these intentions and it has creativity. AI is the study of mental faculties through the use of computational models. The goals of AI practitioners is to find out about the nature of intelligence and to build an intelligent machine, that is, to build a machine that thinks like a human (thinks rationally) and acts like a human (acts rationally).
\\\\
In 1950, Turing suggested that the major components of AI are knowledge, reasoning, language understanding and learning. 

\subsection{Rational Behaviour}
Rational Behaviour is doing the right thing, that which is expected to maximise goal achievement, given the available information.

\subsection{Rational Agents}
A agent is an entity that perceives and acts. In abstract form, an agent is a function that maps percept histories to actions: $f: P \rightarrow A$. For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance. There is a caveat though. Computational limitations make perfect rationality unachievable. Therefore we must design the best program for a given machine's resources.
\subsection{Autonomous Agency}
Autonomy is the ability to operate independently, while agency is a internal goal structure and external behaviour which generally serves to satisfy a goal structure. The requirements of autonomous agency are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pragmatics
\item Generalisation and specialisation
\item Incremental learning
\item Goal-driven learning
\item Defeasibility - open in principle to revision, valid objection, forfeiture, or annulment.
\item Uncertainty
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 2: Intelligent Agents}

\subsection{Agents}

An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon the environment through actuators. For a human agent, sensors would be our eyes or ears, while our actuators would be our hands, legs, mouth and other body parts. For a robot they would be cameras and motors, respectively.
\\
An agent function maps from percept histories to actions: $f: P \rightarrow A$\\
The agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce this function.\\
The agent itself is a combination of the architecture and the program.\\

\subsection{Rationality and Rational Agents}

Rationality depends on a performance measure, the agent's prior knowledge of the environment, the actions that the agent can perform and the percept sequence to data. The formal definition is: 

\begin{verbatim}
For each possible percept sequence, a tonal agent should select an action
that is expected to maximise its performance measure, given the evidence
provided by the percept sequence and the agent's built-in knowledge.
\end{verbatim}
The agent is considered autonomous if its behaviour is determined by its own experience. 

\subsection{Task Environment}

To design a rational argument, you have to specify a task environment. This is made by PEAS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance Measure
\item Environment
\item Actuators
\item Sensors
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example - Automated Taxi Driver}
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance Measure - Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, minimise fuel consumption, maximise profits.
\item Environment - Road types, road contents, customers, operating conditions.
\item Actuators - Control over the car, communication with other vehicles and passengers.
\item Sensors - Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, engine sensors, speech recognizer.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example - Internet Shopping Agent}
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance Measure - Cheap, good quality, appropriate product.
\item Environment - Current WWW sites, vendors.
\item Actuators - Display to user, follow URL, fill in form.
\item Sensors - HTML pages (text, graphics, scripts)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment Types}
The environment type largely determines the agent design.
\begin{itemize}
\item Fully observable vs Partially obserable- An agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at all times.
\item Known vs Unknown - An agent knows the "laws" of the environment.
\item Single vs Multi Agent - An agent operating by itself in an argument
\item Deterministic vs Stochastic - The next state is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent.
\item Episodic vs Sequential - The agent's experience is divided into atomic episodes. The next episode does not depend on previous actions. In each episode the agent precepts a percept and performs a single action.
\item Static vs Dynamic - The agent is unchanged while an agent is deliberating.
\item Discrete vs Continuous) - Pertains to number of states, the way time is handled, and number of percepts and actions. E.G, state may be continuous, but actions may be discrete.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Agent Types}
The agent type is based on how actions are selected.
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple reflex - current percept
\item Model based - + internal state
\item Goal based - + goal
\item Utility based - + utility function
\item Learning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How components of agent programs work?}
Depends on the representations of states:
\begin{itemize}
\item Atomic - each state is indivisible (Search game playing, Markov Decision Processes)
\item Factored - splits each state into attributes, each of which has a value (Propositional logic, Planning, Bayesian Networks, Machine Learning).
\item Structured - represents how things are related to each other (First order logic, Bayesian networks, Semantic networks).
\end{itemize}

\item Optimal decisions
\item $\alpha - \beta$ pruning
\item Imperfect, real-time decisions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{A problem-solving agent}
\begin{verbatim}
Function Simple-Problem-Solving-Agent(percept) 
returns seq
persistent: seq - action sequence, initially null 
state - description of current world stategoal - a goal, initially nullproblem - a problem formulation 

state <- UpdateState(state,percept)goal <- FormulateGoal(state)problem <- FormulateProblem(state,goal) 
seq <- Search(problem)return seq
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Example - Romania}
The problem is: On holiday in romania; currently in Arad. Flight leaves tomorrow from Bucharest.
The formualate goal is to be in Bucharest, and the problem includes the states (various cities) and actions (driving between these cities). The way to find the solution is to find the sequence of cities that you can cross between.
\subsection{Problem Formulation}
The basic constituents of problem formulation are the states, goals, actions and constraints.\\
The state space is the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions. The path in the state space is any sequence of actions leading from one state to another. 
\\
To represent a problem you need
\begin{itemize}
\item An initial state
\item Operators (actions) and a transition model
\item Constraints
\item A goal test
\item A path cost function
\end{itemize}

For the romainian example given above, this would correspond to:
\begin{itemize}
\item An initial state - "at Arad"
\item Operators (actions) {Go(Sibiu, Go(Timisoara),..} and a transition model (Result(In(Arad),Go(Zerind))->In(Zerind)
\item Constraints - None
\item A goal test - In(Bucharest)
\item A path cost function - The sum of all distances, or the number of actions executed.
\end{itemize}

For an algorithm that governs the assembly of an object using a robot, they might be
\begin{itemize}
\item States - Real valued coordinates of robot joint angles
\item Actions - Motions by the robot
\item Constraints - Arm cannot fully rotate in certain angles
\item Goal test - Complete assembly
\item Path cost - time to execute
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Selecting a State Space}

The real world is complex. This means that the state space must be abstracted for problem solving. An abstract state may equal a set of real states (being In(Zerind) might mean you are in one of a few different hotels in Zerind). In this way, an abstract action can be a complex combination of real actions. A trip from one city to another represents many individual actions. A abstract solution is a solution that can be expanded into a set of paths in the real world. Each abstract action should be easier to perform than solving the original problem.

\subsection{Control Strategies}
Control strategies can be separated by two defining characteristics, there tentativeness (irrevocable/tentative) and informedness (uninformed/informed).

\subsection{Tentative Control Strategies}
\subsubsection{Backtracking}
In backtracking we keep one path at a time only. If we fail, we go back to the last decision point and erase the failed path. Backtracking occurs when we generate a previously encountered state description, we pass an arbitrary number of rules without reaching our goal, or there are no more applicable rules.
\subsubsection{Graph Search}
We keep track of several paths simultaneously. This is done using a structure called a search tree/graph. A graph is a set of nodes, while arcs connect certain pairs of nodes (in a directed graph these arcs are one way). If a node $n_i$ is accessible from $n_k$, then there is a path between the two nodes. If you expand a node, you are finding all of its children. 
\\
Using a search tree, the root is the initial state, while it's children are the nodes accessible from it. Leaves are states without visible successor. At each iteration, pick a leaf node and expand it.
\subsection{Search Strategies}
A search strategy is defined by picking the order of node expansion. These strategies are evaluated along several dimensions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Completeness: Does it always find a solution if one exists?
\item Time complexity: Number of nodes generated
\item Space complexity: Maximum number of nodes in memory
\item Optimality: Does it always find a least-cost solution.
\end{itemize}

Time and space complexity are measured in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
\item b: maximum branching factor of the search tree
\item d: depth of the least-cost solution
\item m: maximum depth of any path in the state space (may be infinite)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uninformed search strategies}
These search strategies use only the information available in the problem definition
\subsubsection{Breadth-first search (BFS)}
Expand the shallowest unexpanded node. Uses a large amount of space.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation: FIFO queue. Put successors at the end of the queue.
\item Complete: Yes (if b is finite)
\item Time: $O(b^d)$
\item Space: $O(b^d)$ (keeps every node in memory) 
\item Optimal: Yes (if all actions have the same cost)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Uniform-cost search (UFS)}
Expand the least-cost unexpanded node.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation: insert in order of increasing path cost.(The same as BFS if all steps cost equal).
\item Complete: Yes, if all steps cost >= 0
\item Time: $O(b_{1+floor(C*0)})$, C is the cost of the optimal solution.
\item Space: $O(b_{1+floor(C*0)})$
\item Optimal: Yes - nodes expanded in increasing order of g(n) = cost of path to node n
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Depth-first search}
Expand deepest unexpanded node
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation - LIFO - insert successors in front of queue.
\item Complete - Infinite-state spaces: No, Finite-state spaces: Yes
\item Time - $O(b^m)$, terrible if m is much larger than d
\item Space - $O(bm)$
\item Optimal - No
\subsubsection{Iterative Deepening Search}
Check all nodes of D=0, then D=1, then D=2.
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete: Yes
\item Time: $O(b^d)$
