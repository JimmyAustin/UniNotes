\section{Part A}
If L is an undecidable language, and S is any string, then $L \cup \{S\}$ is also undecidable. This is because any algorithm that computes $L \cup \{S\}$ includes the algorithm that computes the language $L$. As the algorithm for $L$ does not exist (as the language is undecidable), this means the algorithm that computes $L \cup \{S\}$ also doesn't exist, and hence the language is undecidable.
\section{Part B}
For a base case, we will use $k = 0$.
\\
$L^{(0)} = L \cup \{\}$
\\
$L^{(0)} = L$

As L is undecidable, this means that $L^{(0)}$ is also undecidable.

For the induction step, we use $k = k+1$\\
$L^{(k+1)} = L \cup {s_1,s_2,s_3,...,s_k} \cup {s_k+1}$\\
As we have shown in Part A, any language that includes a undecidable language in it's definition will also be undecidable. As $L^{(k+1)}$ includes $L$, $L^{(k+1)}$ is also undecidable for all K.

\section{Part C}

The language $L$ is undecidable because there is no algorithm for generating it. There is however an algorithm for generating the set of all strings. The fact that L is a subset of the set of all strings has nothing to do with the algorithm used for generating it.
